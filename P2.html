          <p>Adrift Vr is an immersive VR experience created through Unity for the course, Immersive Environment. The goal of this Vr experience is to bring awareness of parenting and the loose connection between parents and children. Through this VR experience,
            the audience will be fully immersed in the children’s dreams through the first-person simulation. The audience is able to experience the different emotions that the child is having, through the dream world.

        <div class="flexItem2">
          <p>The team started with affinity diagramming where each of the members brings up a random idea for the project. Through the session, we found that the team is more leaning toward the visual experience with some strong sensory and imaginative immersion.
            We wanted to include elements of exploring the environment with senses of curiosity. In the end, we agree on to create an experience that is able to bring awareness to parenting and the connection with children.
          </p>

          <p>In the team, we agreed on separating the different tasks for each of the members. Since each member has their strength and weakness, the task given to each member will be something that is part of the strength of the member to maximize the effectiveness
            of work. I was given the task of programming and some level design in Unity since that is something that I am very comfortable with.

      </div>

      <p>
        In the level design, I looked through many other examples of environments in games, such as Dear Esther and Lost, with the team. We discussed what kind of feeling or story we trying to provide to the audience that is able to bring awareness to the relationship
        between children and parents. For the environment, I suggested the concept of “Observe and adapt” where we use a similar aesthetics of the environment for the other games and modify it to meet our need of communicating the message in the project.
        The team agreed with my idea of “Observe and adapt” and started looking for some of the elements where other games were able to successfully communicate with the audience. In the end, Our team was able to pull off the project with a lot of positive
        feedback from the audience during the showcase.

        <p>
          Due to this course being an intersession class, the time to complete this project was quite limited. I was able to experience the whole process of creating a VR experience in a very fast-paced environment where a progress check is due weekly. With the
          intense and tight schedule for the project, I was quite surprised and proud of myself and my team that we are able can pull off this project successfully in such a small time frame.
