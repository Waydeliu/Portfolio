          <p>Adventure of Blobby is a 2D platformer created in Unity on the PC and mobile platforms. The game is about a lost blob trying its hardest to navigate through the dangerous forest, solving multiple puzzles, and defeating spooky monsters to find and
            reach its family. The game focuses on the mechanics which allow Blobby to transform into different shapes to overcome the obstacles in the game.

      <div class="flexContainer">

        <div class="flexItem2">
          <p>The team started the project by ideating the main mechanics and the theme of the game. We decided to go for a 2d platformer that involves changing shapes. This allows us to reduce the amount of work for the assets, and be more focused on the
            core mechanics and gameplay of the game.
          </p>
          <p> In this project, my position was the level designer and programmer for the team. I had to create levels that allow the player to feel a sense of progression and challenges which creates a sense of enjoyment for the player. In the programming
            components, I have programmed multiple traps and triggers in the game.

      <p>
        In the later stage of the development, we did a few sessions of internal testing of the game to make sure the mechanics are working properly before we moved onto external testing. Through external playtesting, the team really want to know how other gamers
        or non-gamers feel about the game. We gather multiple people from different background in gaming to test out our game. Through multiple playtests, we were able to to get some feedback and suggestion from the playtester which helped us immensely
        in improving the gameplay. We tried to implement as much of the bug fixes that as found through the playtest to our game in order make the gameplay experience feel responsive and smooth.

      <h1 class="heading-five">Reflection</h1>
      <div class="flexContainer">
        <p>
          Through this project, I was able to develop my understanding of some of the game concepts in gamer types, reward systems, and mechanics. I was able to work closely with people with different talents such as artists and programmers to complete this project.
          In the end, the project was quite successful as our first Unity game, and the team plans to import it into the mobile platform and continue to develop it in the near future.
