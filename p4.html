            This project is a proposal to improve the current building of CoffeeLab UC located in the city center of Eindhoven. In this project, the team is required to design the building through the understanding the space and the design to create a flow in the
            building with the different programs and parti inside the building.

          <p>With this project, my team is assigned the city of Eindhoven to design a building that demonstrates the understanding of the use of space, parti and the program of buildings.

            <p>
              At the start of the project, the team had a fairly hard time to identify the purpose of the building which resulted in a dull and uninspiring design from the feedbacks. The team was falling behind on the project and the mentality of the team was at an
              all time low. However, I was able to stay optimistic about the team and the project. I tried to encourage the team leader through a few private chats and tried to remove his negative thoughts about the course to keep him motivated.

        After multiple session and discussion with the team and the professor, the team was able to generate some interesting ideas for the project. With the recognition of the idea from the professor, we were able to move forward with the project. Within that
        week, our team pushes ourselves to the limit with multiple all-nighters to catch up with the rest of the class. During the presentation, everything went great, even the professor was surprised by how much effort we had put in within a week. In
        this one week, we were able to catch up with other teams and even surpass some of them. In the end, the project was fairly successful with the amount of struggle and problem that we are able to overcome.

          In this project, I was able to learn and understand the different principles in spatial design and graphic design. And most importantly, I saw the importance of communication and teamwork within a team. After seeing many other teams falls apart in this
          project, I am glad that my team is willing to communicate with each other and take criticism from peers, even when we are seriously behind everyone else. I'm really proud of my team willing to cooperate with each other and pull through all the
          problem that we faced together. </p>
