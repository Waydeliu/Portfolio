          <p>This project is a 3D VR environment project for the a music nightclub located in London. The project is aimed to recreate a concert environment in VR where people are able to see the live concert through their phone at home without being there
            in person. Since is it targeted toward the mobile, the client wanted the environment to be as optimized as possible while looking realistic due to the hardware limitations and constraints.

          <p>At the start of the project, I studied the layout of the room with the pictures that they have taken to help me to accurately to recreate the room. With the blueprint they provide, I started grey boxing the layout in Maya, then started to add
            in details to them with the speakers and stands. With the prototype model done, I imported it into Unity to check with the scale of the scene. After some modification, I started to texture the model through substance painter. With the tools
            provided in substance painter, I was able to add realistic materials to the meshes which allow the model to look better even with a low poly count. Finally, I import the textured models back into Unity for the implementation of VR and lightings.

          <p>One of the problems that I have encountered was optimization. Due to this project targeted to mobile devices, it creates a lot of constraints on how much detail and effect I can put into the scene. I went through multiple documentations on optimization
            for mobile VR in the game engine and ask my coworkers for some other suggestion. With their suggestions, I reduced the number of ploys in the models with compressed textures and applied settings that are best suited for mobile platforms to
            help the VR experience to achieve a decent frame rate.

          I enjoyed working on this project. This project allows me to strengthen my modeling and problem-solving skill. I was able to learn new skills in lighting and optimizations in Unity that could help me with future projects. As an individual project, it
          allowed me to demonstrate my organization and communications skills. I would have to manage my time to meet the deadlines for the client as well as communicate with them to meet their need and get feedback for my works.
